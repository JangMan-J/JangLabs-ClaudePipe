# claude-pipe

A lean, standalone **request/reply pipe to a persistent Claude Code agent**.

Spawning `claude -p` per call pays a ~2.4 s cold start every time. `claude-pipe`
spawns **one long-lived `claude` process** in streaming-JSON mode and relays
messages to it over a Unix-domain socket. You pay the cold start **once**, at
`up`; every `send` afterwards costs only Claude's inference latency.

Measured on this machine (Haiku, warm, **lean default**): **~0.9 s/turn**, vs
~2.5 s for `claude -p` cold-start, with full **context retained** across turns
(it's one continuous conversation).

No terminal multiplexer in the hot path: we own the process, so we talk to its
stdin/stdout directly. This is deliberately a thin, reusable **platform** — the
only thing a consumer needs is `claude-pipe send "<text>"`.

## Build

```sh
cargo build --release
# binary at target/release/claude-pipe
```

## Use

```sh
# Start a persistent agent (one process + one socket per session name).
claude-pipe up --detach \
  --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 \
  --system "You are terse. Reply with only the answer."

# Send a message; blocks until the turn completes; prints the reply.
claude-pipe send "press control u"
echo "transcribe this" | claude-pipe send          # message from stdin
claude-pipe send --json "..."                        # full response envelope

# Inspect / stop.
claude-pipe status
claude-pipe down
```

Named sessions run independently, so different projects/purposes don't collide:

```sh
claude-pipe up --detach --session dictation
claude-pipe send --session dictation "..."
```

## The wire contract (all a consumer depends on)

Request (client → daemon), one JSON line over the socket:

```json
{"text": "press control u", "timeout_ms": 60000}
```

Response (daemon → client), one JSON line:

```json
{"ok": true, "text": "<claude reply>", "session_id": "abc123", "turn_ms": 1100}
```

On error/timeout: `{"ok": false, "text": "", "error": "timeout after …"}`.

`claude-pipe send` is just a thin client over this; you can speak the protocol
directly from any language by connecting to the socket.

## How it works

```

- **Serialization.** Claude's streaming stdin/stdout is a single ordered
  channel, so the daemon runs **one turn at a time** (a worker behind an mpsc
  queue). Correct for sequential workloads like dictation; replies can't
  interleave.
- **Turn completion** is detected by Claude's own `result` event — no
  transcript-tailing, no prompt-ready heuristics, no screen scraping.
- **Lean by default.** The persistent `claude` is launched with no tools, no
  MCP servers, no settings/hooks, and a replaced (minimal) system prompt. This
  drops per-turn cache tokens from ~8.7k created / ~17.7k read to **0** and stops
  the `SessionStart` hook from firing every turn — pure overhead for a pipe that
  only relays text. Turn detection is unaffected because it keys off Claude's
  `result` event, not any hook. Pass `--full` to restore Claude's normal agent
  loadout for consumers that need Claude to *act* (run tools, use MCP), not just
  transform text.
- **Persistence.** The `session_id` is saved to a state file; restart with
  `--resume <session_id>` to continue the same conversation.
- **Timeout recovery.** If a turn exceeds `timeout_ms`, its `result` is still
  pending on the stream; the daemon **drains** that stale output before serving
  the next request, so the stream never desyncs (replies stay aligned).

## Runtime files

`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/claude-pipe/` (fallback `/tmp/claude-pipe-$UID/`):

- `<session>.sock` — the request/reply socket
- `<session>.state.json` — pid, current `session_id`, model

## Status

First slice: core pipe (`up` / `send` / `down` / `status`), one model session,
text in / text out. Not yet: multi-message batching, an "attach to watch" pane,
structured-output (`--json`-schema) replies. The wire contract is stable.
